# Notes Application (Fixed)

A lightweight notes app in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Notes are stored in `localStorage` on your browser.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Click **+** to add a note.
3. Type to edit; changes auto‑save.
4. Double‑click a note to delete (you'll be asked to confirm).

## Files
- `index.html` – markup and script/style includes
- `style.css` – layout and styles
- `script.js` – app logic (create/update/delete/persist notes)

## Compatibility
Works offline in any modern desktop or mobile browser. No build tools required.
